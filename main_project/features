Repetition Quality Scoring:
Develop a scoring system for each rep based on form, speed, and range of motion
Use clustering algorithms to identify patterns in high-quality vs low-quality reps
Provide visual feedback on where the rep deviated from ideal form

Fatigue Detection System:
Analyze movement speed, tremor, and form breakdown to detect fatigue
Suggest optimal stopping points to prevent injury
Track fatigue patterns over multiple sessions

RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):


Real-time Vocal Feedback:
